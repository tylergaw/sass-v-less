## A bit of compare and contrast between Sass and Less

I'm making a decision on using Sass or Less on a project. Sass
is my preferred option because I'm used to it, but wanted to take
a look at Less before picking the default.

The examples are key areas that I noticed are different.

After the first tests Iâ€™m with Sass 100%.
